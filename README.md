# Stack Overflow Bug in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: stack overflow due to uncontrolled recursion.  The `bug.js` file contains a recursive function that, under certain conditions, will exceed the JavaScript call stack limit, resulting in a crash.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.
